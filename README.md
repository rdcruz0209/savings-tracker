This app is one of my personal project that I plan to implement in my home. This will track all the major savings/expenses in my house. Currently only providing endpoints for the backend. 
Will add the front-end for this after I finish my Angular course in Udemy

I plan to implement the things listed below. This repository will also serve as my refresher for future projects in case I need to implement the same things or some.
